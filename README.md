# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository. This project showcases my work, skills, and projects.

## Built With

Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Framer Motion: A library for animations in React applications.
React Hook Form : A library to handle forms
Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
