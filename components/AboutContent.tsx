        Hi, I&apos;m Alban, a full-stack developer with two years of experience
        building web applications for the real estate and event management
        industries.
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m passionate about crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly
        experiences using <strong> ReactJS</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>TypeScript</strong>. I&apos;m also enthusiastically diving into
        the world of <strong> Next.js</strong> and eager to apply its power to
        future projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        My experience includes developing several data-driven applications, and
        I&apos;m particularly interested in exploring how technology can be used
        to create more <strong> sustainable</strong> solutions.
